# PATTERN_JOURNAL.md — Recognition Engine for Hema Vardhan

> The point of the whole system: see an unseen problem, recognize the tool.
> This file grows as you solve. The **trigger** ("when you see ___ → consider ___")
> is the most important field — fill it in your own words after each problem.
> Pattern mastery is tracked separately from topic mastery.

## Quick trigger index  (your cheat-sheet — keep it tight)
> This subsumes the old "Interview Pattern Map." When stuck on classification,
> scan this first.

| If you see… | Consider |
|---|---|
| "seen before? / how many times?" | Hashing / frequency map |
| sorted array, find pair/triple | Two pointers |
| compare from both ends | Two pointers |
| longest/shortest **contiguous** subarray/substring | Sliding window |
| sum/count over many ranges; subarray sum = k | Prefix sum (+ hash) |
| sorted, or monotonic yes/no, or minimize-the-max | Binary search (on answer) |
| matching / nesting | Stack |
| next/previous greater or smaller element | Monotonic stack |
| max/min of every window size k | Monotonic deque |
| cycle / middle / kth-from-end in a list | Fast & slow pointers |
| all subsets / permutations / combinations / placements | Backtracking |
| process nodes / depth / paths in a tree | Tree DFS |
| level-by-level / shortest unweighted | BFS |
| grid of connections, components / spread | Graph BFS/DFS, flood fill |
| ordering with prerequisites | Topological sort |
| dynamic connectivity / grouping | Union-Find |
| shortest path with (non-negative) weights | Dijkstra (heap) |
| k largest/smallest / running median | Heap (or two heaps) |
| prefix / autocomplete / many-word lookups | Trie |
| count ways / optimal over choices + overlapping subproblems | Dynamic programming |
| local choice provably safe | Greedy (justify with exchange argument) |
| overlapping intervals / merge / max concurrent | Sort intervals + sweep |
| pairs cancel / toggle / small fixed state set | Bit manipulation / XOR |

## Per-pattern entries
> Mentor adds/updates these as patterns are learned. Template below; keep one

### TEMPLATE
```
### <Pattern name>
Level: L0–L6
Trigger (in my words): when I see ___, I reach for ___
Why it works: <one-sentence intuition>
Template/skeleton: <the reusable code shape, in my chosen language>
Complexity: time __ / space __
Variants & gotchas: <fixed vs variable window, off-by-one, etc.>
Taught me by: <problems that built this — link to MISTAKE_JOURNAL if relevant>
```
