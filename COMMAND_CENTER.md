# 🎛️ COMMAND CENTER — Hema Vardhan (the single front door)

> **Read this first, every session.** It indexes everything — it does NOT duplicate the
> journals (those stay the deep store). One place to answer: *where am I, what's due, what's
> next, where's everything for topic X.* Kira keeps it current; commit it with the rest.

## ▶️ TODAY  *(Kira re-renders this block at session start)*
- **Date:** 2026-06-22
- **Current topic / workspace:** drill1 **P23 Fruit Into Baskets — AC** + **P24 Find Min in Rotated — AC + stress-proven (100k)** → next **P25 Trapping Rain Water** (`practice/drills/drill1/p25-trapped-rain-water/`)
- **Revision due:** P19 prefix-MOD next +3d ≈ 6/24 · **BS-via-discard-ability (6/23) — P24/LC153 done early off that ladder** · **NEW: derive-don't-maintain — cold recall 6/25 + standing window/2ptr audit (P27/P29)** · still overdue: MISTAKE #9 unsorted-gate, #10 restate, #11 atMost · drill tail Q5/Q7/Q8
- **Next action:** P25 Trapping Rain Water (LC42, **hard** — two-pointer / prefix-max). Run the loop; stress-test in `main()` now that local g++ works (`g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall solution.cpp -o x && ./x`).
- **Clean-streak focus:** first-submit-clean streak = **0** (P23 had a Gate-A reading miss + over-engineered optimal; P24 went band-aid→clean, not first-submit) → next clean shot = **P25** (stretch — it's a hard).

## 🗺️ TOPIC HUB  *(status only — links route to the deep files)*
Level scale: L0–L6 (see `PROGRESS.md` §6). 🎥 = Striver video id (`STRIVER_VIDEOS.md`).

| Pattern | Lvl | 🎥 | Solved | Open leaks / re-tests | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 Complexity | L3* | — | — | verify recall | fold into drills |
| M2 Hashing | **L4** | [013] | E:4 M:4 | #9 unsorted→hashing gate (3× fail) | cold drill → L5 |
| M3 Two Pointers | **L4** | [049+] | E:4 M:2 | Dutch-flag re-code (LC75); over-fire gate | weekend LC75 + L5 drill |
| M4 Sliding Window | **L5** ✅ | — | M:3+ | (clean) | keep warm in drills |
| M5 Prefix Sum | **L4** | — | approaching L5 (pulled back, needs track record) | P19 re-derive 6/21 | L5 drill after streak |
| M6 Binary Search | **L4** | [045/046/047/056] | E:2 M:2 | #8 overflow magnitude; LC33/LC74 unsolved | LC33 + LC74 |
| M7 Stacks + Monotonic | **L2** | [297][298][300][301] | 0 | not yet coded from memory | Valid Parens from memory → L3 |
| M8 Queues/Deque | L0 | — | — | — | after M7 |
| M9+ Recursion → DP → Graphs | L0 | see STRIVER_VIDEOS | — | — | back half (heavier per-pattern) |

> Only **M4 Sliding Window** is a confirmed L5. M5 was claimed L5 then honestly pulled back to
> L4 (one clean call ≠ track record). Don't inflate.

## 🧭 MODE LEGEND — which mode am I in? (this is why folders are split)
| Mode | Folder | Purpose | Promotes level? | How it runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LEARN** | `learn/<NN>-Topic/` | first meeting of a pattern | builds toward L3 | full Socratic, brute→bridge→optimal |
| **PRACTICE** | `practice/` (`practice/<NN>-Topic/`, `practice/drills/drillN/`, `practice/day-NN/`) | reps, calibration, disguised recognition | **no** (it's training) | ≤1 hint then stop; no answer key on drills |
| **TEST** | `test/` (`test/cold-recognition/`, `/drill`, `/interview`) | cold, closed-book | **yes — the only L4→L5 path** | no help; help costs signal |

Rule of thumb: if Kira is teaching/hinting, it's LEARN or PRACTICE. If you're cold and alone, it's TEST.

## 🩹 LEAK SCOREBOARD — boss's execution bottleneck (the #1 thing we're fixing)
> Recognition is strong; **execution** is the leak. Every bug updates this; every clean solve grows the streak.
> 🔴 = fired recently · 🟡 = building clean days · 🟢 = reflex forming. Update dates whenever a leak fires.

| Leak | Last seen | Days clean | Catch it with |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Boundary / index / sentinel** | 2026-06-22 | 0 🔴 | Gate C: 4 boundary edges + ANSWER edge — **P24: `r=mid-1` discarded the min** (exact-target template on a boundary search). Cue: "could mid be the answer?" → keep it (`r=mid`, `l<r`, return nums[l]). |
| **Band-aid / redundant maintained state** (patch over wrong structure) | 2026-06-22 | 0 🔴 | **⭐ Derive-don't-maintain:** P23 hand-synced 6 vars (cut to 2); P24 bolted on an `ans` tracker to patch a bad `mid±1`. Audit before submit: any var that's really `r-l+1`? any two vars that must agree? |
| **Constraint-drop / reading miss** (brute omits a stated rule, or misreads what's asked) | 2026-06-22 | 0 🔴 | Gate A: **P23 dry run summed type VALUES instead of counting fruits** — caught by the `[2,2,2]→6-from-3-trees` trace. Every constraint load-bearing; restate WHAT is returned. |
| **Reduction trap** (drops a constraint) | 2026-06-20 | 1 🟡 | Gate B: hostile input, run ORIGINAL vs REDUCED |
| **Overflow magnitude** (#8) | 2026-06-20 | 1 🟡 | Gate C: seed/accumulator type, size the number |
| **Gate slip** (sorted?→2ptr vs hash; set vs map) | 2026-06-21 | 0 🔴 | Gate C: container + sorted check |

**First-submit-clean streak:** `0`  ·  **best:** `0`  (P23 AC — Gate-A reading miss + over-engineered optimal · P24 AC — band-aid→clean, not first-submit → next clean shot = **P25**, a hard)
*(A clean solve = AC on judge with ZERO boundary band-aids and no overflow/reduction/gate slip.)*
*Positive signals 2026-06-22: **the ⭐ DERIVE-DON'T-MAINTAIN principle TRANSFERRED across patterns in one session** — taught on a window (P23), he applied it to BINARY SEARCH an hour later (P24: killed his own `ans` band-aid → clean `while(l<r)` converge). **TRACE-FIRST caught BOTH misses** (P23 reading, P24 boundary) — his #1 modality confirmed again. **First local stress-test ever run** (100k cases, oracle silent) — toolchain unblocked, this is now standing. **He CALLED his own traps** twice (P23 "this is over-engineered", P24 "this is too easy = I'm dodging the rep"). Residual leak = FIRST-INSTINCT execution (defaults to exact-target BS template + redundant maintained state), then fixes on review — now NAMED + SCHEDULED.*
